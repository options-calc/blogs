# Definitions

## Calls vs. Puts

- A `put` is the right to sell an option at a set (strike) price.

- A `call` is the right to buy an option at a set (strike) price.


## In-the-money vs. Out-of-money

- An `in-the-money (ITM) option` has intrinsic value.

- An `out-of-money (OTM) option` does not have intrinsic value.

### Puts

- in-the-money: strike price > trading price

- out-of-money: trading price > strike price

If a stock is trading at $50 and the strike price of a put is $60, then this put option has intrinsic value. The owner of the put has the right to sell it at $60, which is already $10 above the trading price. This put is `in-the-money`. An `out-of-money` put is when the strike price is below the trading price.
